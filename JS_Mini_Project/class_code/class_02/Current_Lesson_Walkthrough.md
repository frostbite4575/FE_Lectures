# Class 2 Walkthrough: JavaScript Intro & DOM Manipulation

This guide will walk you through adding your first JavaScript to the Campus Club Manager project. You will display a welcome message using JavaScript.

---

## 1. Update `index.html`

Add the following line just before the closing `</body>` tag in your `index.html` file:

```html
<!-- ...existing HTML... -->
<script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

> **Placement:** This should be the very last thing before `</body>`. If you already have a closing `</body>` tag, insert the script tag right above it.

---

## 2. Create `app.js`

Create a new file named `app.js` in your `class_02` folder. Add the following code at the top of the file:

```js
// At the top of app.js
// Select the header and set a welcome message
// This will change the text inside the <h1> tag

document.querySelector("h1").textContent = "Welcome to Campus Club Manager!";
```

> **Placement:** This should be the first code in your `app.js` file.

## 3. What you should see

- The page header should now say "Welcome to Campus Club Manager!" (set by JavaScript)
- If you view the page source, the original HTML still says "Campus Club Manager"â€”the change happens in the browser

You have now completed the steps for Class 2. In the next lesson, you'll add data and render it to the page using JavaScript!
