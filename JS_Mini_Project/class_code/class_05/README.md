# Campus Club Manager — Class 5 (Completed)

## Conversation

- Garrett: I want people to add and remove members right on each card, without a bunch of fussy buttons.
- Codi: Let’s keep it simple. I’ll show a tiny Members area on each card with an Add Member box and a Remove link next to each person. The page will watch for these clicks in one place so it stays calm. No blockers.
- Garrett: Love it. Straightforward and easy to grow.

## Codi’s requirements (from our chat)

- Show a Members section on each club card with a count and a short list.
- Add a text box and an “Add Member” button on the card to add a person.
- Put a “Remove” link next to each name to remove a person.
- Have the page listen in one place on the list for these clicks (one listener).
- Use our Club/Member classes when adding or removing; update the card right after.
- Light style helpers so the link-style Remove and inline add row look tidy; keep the tab title on Class 5.

## Codi’s user stories

- As a visitor, I can add a person to a club on its card and see the count change.
- As a visitor, I can remove a person from a club.
- As a visitor, I see a small note if it can’t add (duplicate name or club full).
- As a developer, the page watches for Add/Remove in one place instead of many.
- As a developer, the card redraws from the club info right after any change.

## What good looks like

- Each card shows “Members (N)” with a list; empty lists say “No members yet”.
- “Add Member” and “Remove” both work; counts and lists update immediately.
- New clubs still appear at the end when added from the top form.
- No console errors; the page feels smooth.

## Afternoon debrief (bootcamp tie‑in)

- Codi: In bootcamp we practiced keeping the page calm—watch clicks in one spot and redraw from the info you have. That keeps things clear and avoids a tangle of tiny handlers.
- Garrett: That’s the goal—easy to use, easy to teach, and set up to grow without surprises.
