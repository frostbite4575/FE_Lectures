# Campus Club Manager — Class 12 (Completed)

Break room, 10:28 AM.

- Codi: Final lap—how are you, Garrett?
- Garrett: Can this talk to a server? I want to see it loading and know if saves succeed.
- Codi: I’ll simulate a server with fetch to a local JSON for seed, add a save that sometimes fails, and show loading/success/error status without breaking our local persistence.

## Codi’s user stories

- As a visitor, I see a loading state while data is fetched.
- As a visitor, I see success and error messages for save operations.
- As a developer, first boot prefers server seed if no saved state exists.
- As a developer, local persistence remains source of truth for offline reliability.
