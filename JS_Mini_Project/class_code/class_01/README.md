# Campus Club Manager — Class 1 (Completed)

## Conversation

- Garrett: What are we kicking off today?
- Codi: Morning standup — Done: opened the workspace. Today: get a clean page up with our title and an empty spot for clubs, and prove JS is wired with a tiny console message. Blockers: none. Bootcamp lesson I’ll use: start tiny and keep it visible.
- Garrett: Perfect. Let’s get something real on screen.

## Codi’s requirements (from our chat)

- Create `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `app.js` in the same folder.
- Add a header with the title “Campus Club Manager” and a short subtitle.
- Add an empty section with id `club-info` where clubs will render later.
- Link `styles.css` and `app.js` correctly; no 404s.
- In `app.js`, log a short “setup complete” message so we know JS runs.

## Codi’s user stories

- As a visitor, I see a clear app title at the top of the page.
- As a developer, I see a console message on load that confirms JavaScript is connected.
- As a developer, there’s a dedicated `#club-info` area ready for future content.

## What good looks like

- Title and subtitle are visible.
- The `#club-info` section exists (it’s empty for now).
- The console shows: “Class 1 setup complete. Ready for Class 2!”.
- No console errors.

## Afternoon debrief (bootcamp tie‑in)

- Codi: This is the bootcamp move—keep it tiny, real, and visible. Now we have clean bones to build on.
- Garrett: That nails it—clear title, JS wired, and a place for clubs next class.
