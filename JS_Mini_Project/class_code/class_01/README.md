# Campus Club Manager — Class 1 (Completed)
**Lesson:** Kickoff & Setup  
**Goal:** Create a minimal, working web project with HTML, CSS, and JS linked correctly.

## Files
- `index.html` — basic HTML scaffold with a header, empty `#club-info` container, and a footer
- `styles.css` — tiny, beginner-friendly styles
- `app.js` — minimal JavaScript with a console sanity check and footer year

## Run
Open `index.html` in your browser. You should see the title and a console message:
```
Class 1 setup complete. Ready for Class 2!
```

## Next
In **Class 2**, you'll add seed data, a couple of math helpers, and render a simple club list.
