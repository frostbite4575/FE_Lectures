# Campus Club Manager — JS Mini Project

Break room, 8:47 AM.

- Garrett: You know what a new app idea would be that would benefit the company?
- Codi: Tell me! I’m fresh out of bootcamp and itching to ship something.
- Garrett: We’ve got all these internal clubs—running, chess, book club, you name it. People want a simple spot to see what exists, how full they are, and maybe RSVP to events. Nothing huge. Just useful.
- Codi: Love it. In bootcamp we started small and layered features each week. We can do the same here—ship a tiny slice, then keep leveling up.

- Garrett: What’s the tiniest possible version?
- Codi: Start super small: a single page with a clean header, some basic styles, and a little JavaScript to prove everything’s wired. Then seed a couple of pretend clubs so we can see it.
- Garrett: That sounds doable today.
- Codi: Exactly. As I learn more, we keep growing it: add a form to create clubs, manage members on each card, then add events with friendly dates, save to the browser so changes stick, maybe even give each club its own URL.

- Garrett: Walk me through how this grows as your bootcamp brain unlocks new stuff.
- Codi: Sure!

  - Step 1 — Basics: HTML/CSS/JS scaffold. Serve it with Live Server so links and modules behave.
  - Step 2 — Data on screen: Keep a tiny array of clubs, write small math helpers (seats left, percent full), and render simple cards.
  - Step 3 — Forms & guardrails: Add a Create Club form, prevent page reload on submit, trim/validate inputs, and block duplicates.
  - Step 4 — Real structure: Introduce small classes (Club, Member, Event) so behavior lives with data and the UI stays clean.
  - Step 5 — Inline actions: Add/Remove Member directly on each card using event delegation (one listener, dynamic buttons).
  - Step 6 — Findability: Search, filter to “has seats,” and sorting so people can discover clubs.
  - Step 7 — Smoother UX: Debounce search and compose small list transforms so it feels snappy.
  - Step 8 — Grown‑up folders: Split into ES modules (models, store, ui, utils) so files are small and teachable.
  - Step 9 — Events done right: Use nanoid for unique IDs and dayjs for human‑friendly dates (“in 3 days”, “Past”).
  - Step 10 — It remembers: Save to localStorage, plus Import/Export/Reset so data can move around or restart cleanly.
  - Step 11 — Mini routing: Hash routes for Home and Club Detail so each club has a shareable URL.
  - Step 12 — A taste of servers: Fetch seed JSON on first load and simulate a save with loading/success/error states.

- Garrett: That’s a neat path—useful from day one, and it gets more polished as you learn.
- Codi: Exactly. Each step stays small, but together it turns into a legit little app the team can actually use.

- Garrett: What’s in it for the company right away?
- Codi: Visibility and momentum. Day one you can point folks to a page that shows clubs exist. A week later they can add their own. Not long after, you’re browsing events, searching, sorting, and everything persists between visits.

- Garrett: I like it. Let’s kick it off.
- Codi: I’ll spin up the skeleton today—clean header, styles, and a tiny script. Then we’ll drop in sample clubs and keep building from there. I’ll keep it clear and beginner‑friendly so anyone peeking at the code can follow along.

- Garrett: Perfect. Keep the vibe practical and the steps small.
- Codi: Deal. Bootcamp habits engaged.
