# Campus Club Manager — JS Mini Project

Break room, 8:47 AM.

- Garrett: You know what a new app idea would be that would benefit the company?
- Codi: Tell me! I just started a bootcamp, and I’d love to build this while I learn.
- Garrett: We’ve got a bunch of internal clubs—running, chess, book club. Folks want a simple spot to see what exists, how full they are, and maybe RSVP to events. Nothing huge—just useful.
- Codi: Perfect. In bootcamp we start small and layer features over time. We can ship a tiny slice now and grow it as I progress.

- Garrett: What’s the tiniest version?
- Codi: One page with a clean header, basic styles, and a tiny JavaScript file to prove wiring. Seed a couple of pretend clubs so we can see it.
- Codi: As I learn more, I’ll keep adding features in small steps:

  - letting people add new clubs themselves with friendly messages if something’s off
  - managing members right on the card without jumping around
  - quick search, hide full clubs, and simple sorting so it’s easy to find things
  - adding events that show dates in a way humans actually read
  - having your changes stick when you come back, and an easy way to back things up
  - giving each club its own link you can share
  - showing little loading and success/error notes so it feels like a real app

- Garrett: Love the roadmap—useful from day one and more polished as you learn.
- Codi: Exactly. I’ll spin up the skeleton today and keep building while I learn.

- Garrett: Let’s kick it off.
- Codi: Deal.
