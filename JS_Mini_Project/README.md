# Campus Club Manager — Project Overview

## Kickoff chat

- Codi: Garrett! I just joined a coding bootcamp and I’m so excited. I’m learning something called MEAN Full Stack Development.
- Garrett: That’s awesome—congrats! I’ve got a project we can work on together while you learn. We’ll meet every morning for a quick standup and do a short debrief later in the day.

## How we’ll work

- Morning Standup: quick check-in in plain English—what’s done, what’s next, any blockers.
- Afternoon Debrief: short recap tying what we built back to what Codi learned in bootcamp.
- Keep it simple and welcoming; we’ll grow the app step by step.

## What we’re building

A simple, friendly “Campus Club Manager” that grows with Codi’s skills. We’ll keep the language plain, the steps small, and the app useful from day one. Each class is just another idea we turn into something real together.
