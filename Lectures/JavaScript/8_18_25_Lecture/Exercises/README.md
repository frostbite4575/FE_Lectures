## ex01 — Grocery list (add and render)

- What: Read input, trim/validate, push into an array, and render rows in a container.
- Why: Arrays + render is the foundation of most UI work; validation prevents bad state early.

## ex02 — Grocery list (validation + duplicate guard)

- What: Validate input and prevent duplicates before adding; display friendly inline messages.
- Why: Early validation keeps state clean and UX clear; patterns mirror future forms.

## ex03 — Empty state + footer year

- What: Show a purposeful empty state when a list is empty; write the current year into a footer span.
- Why: Good UX for “nothing yet” is common; rendering the year from code keeps content fresh automatically.
