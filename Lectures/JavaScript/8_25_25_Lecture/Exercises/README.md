# Exercises overview

Class 5 focus (up to Class 5 only): arrays + lists, simple state, render-after-change, add/remove by id, forms + validation. No search/filter/sort yet (that’s Class 6).

- ex01 — Todo list add/remove by id
  - What: Build a tiny todo list with an id helper, add via form, remove via button, render from state.
  - Why: Arrays, ids, and re-render are core UI skills you’ll use constantly.

- ex02 — Bookshelf: add/remove with basic validation
  - What: Add books (title, author), reject empty titles, prevent duplicates by title (case-insensitive), remove by id.
  - Why: Input validation and duplicate checks keep data clean; rendering confirms state.

- ex03 — Grocery items with quantities
  - What: Add groceries with name + quantity, show a summary line (total items), remove by id.
  - Why: Combine form handling, arrays, and a small derived value you render after state changes.
