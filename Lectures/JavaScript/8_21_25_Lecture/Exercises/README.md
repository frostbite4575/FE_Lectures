# Exercises overview

These exercises reinforce Class 04 concepts (and earlier): simple classes/constructors, basic getters, arrays and list rendering, id-based updates.

## ex01 — Book progress card (class + getter)

- What: Class with constructor + getter, single state object, render to a stable id.
- Why: Centralize derived data, keep UI in sync by rendering from state.

## ex02 — Task list (ids + remove)

- What: Id helper, add/remove by id with findIndex/splice, duplicate guard by title (case-insensitive).
- Why: Stable ids make updates reliable; arrays + render are core UI skills.

## ex03 — Upcoming releases (future filter + sort)

- What: Store Date once, filter future items, sort ascending, render list; toggle a watched flag.
- Why: Transformations (filter/sort) and status toggles are common patterns.
