# FE Lectures

This repo is organized for our course. It contains the live lecture code and the ongoing mini project we build together.

## Repository Structure

- `JS_Mini_Project/`
  - `class_code/` — Per-class snapshots. Each class folder includes:
    - `Introduction.md` — What we learned previously, today, and next.
    - `README.md` — Class summary and how to run.
    - `Current_Lesson_Walkthrough.md` — Step-by-step delta from the previous class.
  - `Project_files/` — In-class working directory that’s updated live each session.
- `Lectures/` — Code typed during each lecture (dated folders).

## How We’ll Use This

1. We build on the same project each week to apply new concepts in a real codebase.
2. Use the files in `JS_Mini_Project/class_code/<class_XX>/` to follow along or catch up:
   - Read the `Introduction.md` to see context.
   - Use the `Current_Lesson_Walkthrough.md` to update your app from the last class.
3. The `Project_files/` directory is where we do the live coding during class.

## Getting Started

- Open any class folder’s `index.html` with a local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server).
- Refer to that class’s `README.md` for specifics.
