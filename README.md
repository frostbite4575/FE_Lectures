# FE Lectures

This repo is organized for our course. It contains the live lecture code and the ongoing mini project we build together.

## Live coding repo: FE_Projects

We live-code during class in a separate repository named FE_Projects. That repo is the in-class working app we update in real time. This FE_Lectures repo contains lesson snapshots, walkthroughs, and supporting materials so you can review, compare, and run each class at your own pace.

- Live coding repo: https://github.com/jrletner/FE_Projects
- Use FE_Lectures (this repo) for per-class instructions and runnable snapshots in `JS_Mini_Project/class_code/<class_XX>/`.

## Repository Structure

- `JS_Mini_Project/`
  - `class_code/` — Per-class snapshots. Each class folder includes:
    - `README.md` — Class summary and how to run.
    - `Current_Lesson_Walkthrough.md` — Step-by-step delta from the previous class.
- `Lectures/` — Code typed during each lecture (dated folders).
- `Resources/` — Supporting docs and tools for the course:
  - `VSCode_Extensions.md` — Recommended VS Code extensions.
- Live project repo — In-class working directory (updated live each session):
  - https://github.com/jrletner/FE_Projects

## How We’ll Use This

1. We build on the same project each week to apply new concepts in a real codebase.
2. Use the files in `JS_Mini_Project/class_code/<class_XX>/` to follow along or catch up:

- Skim the class `README.md` for context (goals, what changed, how to run).
- Use `Current_Lesson_Walkthrough.md` to update your app from the previous class, step by step.

## Getting Started

- Open any class folder’s `index.html` with a local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server).
- Refer to that class’s `README.md` for specifics.

## Resources

- JavaScript Video Link
- VS Code extensions: `Resources/VSCode_Extensions.md`
  - What’s inside: A short, curated list of editor extensions we’ll use in class (formatting, HTML/JS helpers, Live Server, dotenv, and optional framework snippets like Svelte/React).
  - How to use: Open the file, install items you don’t have from the VS Code Marketplace. Prettier + Live Server are the key ones for this repo.
