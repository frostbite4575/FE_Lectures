# Copilot README Narrative Instructions

Purpose: keep all lesson READMEs consistent with a friendly, casual break-room style that’s easy to read and teach from.

## tone

- Casual, friendly, morning break-room energy.
- Garrett states a simple problem in plain language.
- Codi replies in everyday language, referencing what he learned in bootcamp and how it can help.
- Garrett is excited and thankful.
- Then Codi converts that plain-English plan into “Requirements” and “User stories.”
- Codi’s Morning debrief should sound excited and conversational when tying solutions back to bootcamp lessons.

## structure (per README)

1. Title

- `# Campus Club Manager — Class X (Completed)`

2. Break room conversation

- First bullet: Garrett’s problem in everyday words.
- Second bullet: Codi’s everyday-language answer referencing bootcamp skills.
- Third bullet: Garrett’s excited thanks.

3. Codi’s requirements (from our chat)

- 4–6 bullets translating the plan into clear, actionable requirements.
- Use concrete file names, functions, and validations where helpful.

4. Codi’s user stories

- 4–7 bullets in classic user-story form:
  - As a [visitor/developer/instructor], I [action] so that [outcome].

5. What good looks like

- 3–5 concise bullets spelling out observable success criteria (what should be visible/true in the UI and console).

6. Morning debrief (bootcamp tie‑in)

- Short Codi ↔ Garrett wrap-up.
- Codi connects the day’s solution to concrete bootcamp concepts (e.g., scaffolding, arrays + pure helpers, form validation + preventDefault).
- Garrett restates his original problem and how the app now solves it.
